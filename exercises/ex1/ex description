You are an internet provider and you work with a database.

In company's database (a dictionary) you have String keys that correspond to
usernames of your users, which they use to log-in to your site,
and the values for the keys are dictionaries that hold account
information, like the amount of days remaining before the subscription expires
as well as the plan type (Standard or Premium).

You need to implement a function that takes the database object and a command
like "remove-user_name" or "add-different_user_name-subscription_type" and executes the
command.

All the inputs are valid and you only need to worry about the user_name part,
because there might already be a user with this name in the database.

The command strings follow strict rules.
For now you only need to implement two commands: add and remove.

1. add takes two parameters user_name and subscription_type, so the basic
add command looks something like:

"add-crazy_mike-Premium"

Which means that you add to the database a new user with the name "crazy_mike"
and set their subscription type to Premium.
You need to note, that when you add a user with a Standard subscription, it
starts today and ends in 90 days, but when you add a user with a Premium
subscription it ends in 365 days.

2. remove takes one parameter user_name, so the basic remove command looks
like:

"remove-crazy_mike"

Which means that you remove from the database the user with the name
"crazy_mike" You need to note, that you can only remove the user from the
database, if their subscription ends within a day, so for example the 
crazy_mike's subscription still has 2 days, and you are asked to remove the
user, functon should return false and the database should be unchanged,
if it was 1 day, you would remove the user from the database, and return true,
indicating that function ran successfully.

Add, remove, subscription_type are all keywords, and keywords in the command line should work case-insensitively.

Also, sometimes the database corrupts and some random generated users become present, they are apparent by the invalid
subscription type. After executing the prompted command you should remove all the entries with invalid subscription types
(subscription types which are neither Standard nor Premium)

You should only remove corrupted entries if the command was executed, i.e before the function returns True.
