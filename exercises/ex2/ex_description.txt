Sandwich analysis

You are tasked with the sandwich analysis.

At your disposal, a diary of a perfectionist, where he types out all the sandwiches he ever made,
and your task is to look through the diary to find the toppings he used the most.
Out of toppings he used the most the perfect sandwich will be created and output as a string.

Keep in mind that in the diary, toppings have a specific order, and you need to find
the most used topping for every layer. All the sandwiches are constructed with exactly 4 toppings, so the perfect
sandwich will also have 4 toppings. Toppings are ordered from layer 1 to layer 4 starting from the bottom bun at layer 0
and the fourth topping at layer 4.

Let's assume we collected the data and got the following statistics:
    Best bun: "american white bread"
        "ham" at layer 1 used 30 times,
        "cheese" at layer 2 used 16 times,
        "garlic sauce" at layer 3 used 18 times,
        "diced red onion" at layer 4 used 10 times.

    Then the best sandwich will be made out of all these ingredients and the resulting sandwich string will be:
        "Sandwich on american white bread with ham, cheese, garlic sauce and diced red onion"

If there are multiple topping with the same number of occurrences then the first that was occurred in the data is picked.
